# Getting Started

<!-- Add **Markdown or React** files to `src/pages` to create a **standalone page**:

- `src/pages/index.js` â†’ `localhost:3000/`
- `src/pages/foo.md` â†’ `localhost:3000/foo`
- `src/pages/foo/bar.js` â†’ `localhost:3000/foo/bar` -->

<!-- ## Create your first React Page

Create a file at `src/pages/my-react-page.js`:

```jsx title="src/pages/my-react-page.js"
import React from "react";
import Layout from "@theme/Layout";

export default function MyReactPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>My React page</h1>
      <p>This is a React page</p>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

A new page is now available at [http://localhost:3000/my-react-page](http://localhost:3000/my-react-page). -->
