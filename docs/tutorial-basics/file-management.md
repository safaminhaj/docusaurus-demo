**Uploading, Managing, and Organizing Files**

Now that your account is set up, let's start uploading and organizing files.

## Step 3: Uploading Files to C-Cloud

Uploading files is easy! Hereâ€™s how:

Click on the Upload button in the dashboard.

Select files from your device or drag & drop them into the upload area.

Choose a folder to save the file or create a new one.

Add tags to categorize your file (e.g., "Project A", "Invoices").

Click Upload to finish.

ðŸ“Œ Note: The system automatically saves previous versions, so you donâ€™t lose important changes.

## Step 4: Organizing Files in Folders & Tags

To keep your files structured:

Navigate to My Files in the left panel.

Click New Folder to create a project-specific folder.

Move files into the appropriate folders by dragging and dropping.

Use the Search bar to find files using keywords or tags.

ðŸ”¥ Quick Tip: Use color-coded tags for better visibility and filtering.
