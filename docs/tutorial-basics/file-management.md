# File Management

<!-- Documents are **groups of pages** connected through:

- a **sidebar**
- **previous/next navigation**
- **versioning**

## Create your first Doc

Create a Markdown file at `docs/hello.md`:

```md title="docs/hello.md"
# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

A new document is now available at [http://localhost:3000/docs/hello](http://localhost:3000/docs/hello).

## Configure the Sidebar

Docusaurus automatically **creates a sidebar** from the `docs` folder.

Add metadata to customize the sidebar label and position:

```md title="docs/hello.md" {1-4}
---
sidebar_label: "Hi!"
sidebar_position: 3
---

# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

It is also possible to create your sidebar explicitly in `sidebars.js`:

```js title="sidebars.js"
export default {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    "intro",
    // highlight-next-line
    "hello",
    {
      type: "category",
      label: "Tutorial",
      items: ["tutorial-basics/create-a-document"],
    },
  ],
};
``` -->

**Uploading, Managing, and Organizing Files**

Now that your account is set up, let's start uploading and organizing files.

## Step 3: Uploading Files to C-Cloud

Uploading files is easy! Hereâ€™s how:

Click on the Upload button in the dashboard.

Select files from your device or drag & drop them into the upload area.

Choose a folder to save the file or create a new one.

Add tags to categorize your file (e.g., "Project A", "Invoices").

Click Upload to finish.

ðŸ“Œ Note: The system automatically saves previous versions, so you donâ€™t lose important changes.

## Step 4: Organizing Files in Folders & Tags

To keep your files structured:

Navigate to My Files in the left panel.

Click New Folder to create a project-specific folder.

Move files into the appropriate folders by dragging and dropping.

Use the Search bar to find files using keywords or tags.

ðŸ”¥ Quick Tip: Use color-coded tags for better visibility and filtering.
